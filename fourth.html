<h1>Uranus</h1>
<p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun in our solar system and is known for its unique characteristics. Here is a comprehensive overview of the planet, including its physical properties, composition, atmosphere, rings, moons, and exploration.</p>

<h3>Atmosphere:</h3><p>
Uranus has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of hydrogen and helium with traces of methane. The presence of methane in the upper atmosphere absorbs red light but reflects blue light, giving Uranus its characteristic blue-green appearance. The atmosphere also experiences strong winds
Rings:
Uranus has a system of rings surrounding it, although they are not as prominent or well-known as Saturn's rings. The rings are relatively dark and composed mostly of small particles ranging from micrometers to a few meters in size. The exact origin of these rings is still not fully understood.</p>

<h3>Moons:</h3><p>
Uranus has 27 known moons, each named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. The five largest moons are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. These moons vary in size and composition, with some displaying interesting geological features such as canyons, cliffs, and impact craters.  </p>

<h1> Nepture</h1>
<p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in our solar system. It is classified as an ice giant, along with its counterpart Uranus. Neptune is named after the Roman god of the sea due to its deep blue color, which is caused by the presence of methane in its atmosphere.

Neptune has a total of 14 known moons, with the largest and most notable being Triton. Triton is unique among the moons in our solar system because it orbits Neptune in a retrograde direction, opposite to the planet's rotation. This suggests that Triton was captured by Neptune's gravity rather than forming alongside it.</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3><p>
Neptune is a fascinating planet in our solar system, known for its vibrant blue color, powerful storms, and unique moon Triton.Further exploration and research are needed to uncover more secrets about this icy giant.</p>
